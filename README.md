  This program is design to find the edited distance between two strands of DNA. To test this program, I use the example in assignment description to see if I the program could produce the same results. I put one stand into test1.txt and other into test2.txt. After testing the program and have success with it, I tried different variations of DNA strands. I was successful with every test except for test evolving two large stands of DNA. When running, it wouldnâ€™t return normal output but instead the program would return the large value instead of zero.
